Man, I got all the flavor, bitches say I'm delicious
I'ma have all you motherfuckers laying in ditches
I'ma kill all you rappers, I'ma aim with precision (Damn)
They was rocking with your ass 'til they made a decision (That's right)
All my friends making millions 'cause they knowin' my vision (Ooh)
A lot of entertainers crash, I can see the collision
Destined to make the money, I was great at division
I'm finna take all your food and I'ma eat up the dishes (Ayy)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg & MadeinTYO]
Everything up off the table, I'm starving (Huh, yeah)
See a nigga ball, Steve Harvey (Huh, right)
Going off the dome, no Sharpie (Huh, yeah)
Working out, looking like a Barbie (That's right, Ken)
Better not play boy like Carti (Huh)
Your ass'll get smoked, Bob Marley (Huh, yeah)
This ain't no game, no Atari (Huh, ooh ooh)
Lam' movin' bad like Kentucky Derby (Huh, ooh, ooh)

[Refrain: MadeinTYO & A$AP Ferg]
One, two, three, she a pro with the neck (Wam)
One, two, three, four, hoppin' on a jet (Yeah)
Touch down, NY jawn on the way (Ooh)
Brown skin, light skin, she woke up today (Skrrt, that's right)
Since I fly a lot (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ferg, tell Jacob that I need a watch (Bling blaow)
You know the ones with the color ice drops (Skrrt, skrrt)
We gettin' money, taking bets
Check my material, I'm hella fresh (Ooh, ooh)


[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Man, I got all the flavor, bitches say I'm delicious (Yeah)
I'ma have all you motherfuckers laying in ditches (Right)
I'ma kill all you rappers, I'ma aim with precision
They was rocking with your ass 'til they made a decision (That's right)
All my friends making millions 'cause they knowin' my vision (Ooh)
A lot of entertainers crash, I can see the collision
Destined to make the money, I was great at division (Damn)
I'm finna take all your food and I'ma eat up the dishes, hey (Ooh ooh)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Just got the keys to the mansion (Huh, yeah)
Diamonds like Chris Brown dancin' (Huh)
Wonder why my bitch catch a tantrum (Huh, right)
Helicopter, golf course landing (Huh, that's right)
At Jay house on New Year (Huh)
Lenny S, got the whole crew here (Huh, yeah)
Crew left mink and gator shoes here (Huh, ooh ooh)
I swear this shit feeling like a zoo here (Huh)

[Refrain: MadeinTYO & A$AP Ferg]
One, two, three, she a pro with the neck (Wam)
One, two, three, four, hoppin' on a jet (Yeah)
Touch down, NY jawn on the way (Ooh)
Brown skin, light skin, she woke up today (Skrrt)
Since I fly a lot (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ferg, tell Jacob that I need a watch (Bling blaow)
You know the ones with the color ice drops (Skrrt, skrrt)
